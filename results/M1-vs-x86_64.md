# Apple M1 Silicon (ARM64) vs. Intel/AMD (x86_64)

## Background

Just some quick benchmarking of an Apple M1 MacBook Air against some Intel/AMD based systems to compare CPU speeds using a few common programing languages. 

## The Benchmark

The benchmark is to compute the Fibonacci sequence to the 47th place, using a simple, inefficient recursive method without memorization. The source files for all languages is just one level up from this document. Yes, I know there are more efficient ways to compute the sequence, that's not the point of this.  Below is the Python version that's been translated to Go and R: 

```Python
import time

def fib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = 47
    start = time.time()
    res = fib(x)
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print("Python3 Computed fib(%s)=%s in %0.2f seconds" % (x, res, elapsed))
```

## The Systems

The systems included in the benchmark range from slim lightweight laptops with mobile class processors all the way up to power hungry, rack-mounted High Performance Computing (HPC) nodes. It's worth noting that the M1 MacBook Air is a light/thin, fanless laptop that currently retails for just $999.

## The Results

I had previously seen some benchmarks online comparing the M1 MacBooks to Intel based MacBooks (video encoding performance) so I knew they had impressive CPU performance, and these results confirm that. The little M1 MacBook Air had no problem beating all other systems for each language tested. The M1 stayed relatively cool during all testing, while the MacBook Pro was hot and loud (fans) during the Python and R tests. While the M1 Air performs very well, without an active cooling system, it's probably not a good option for running many simultaneous CPU hungry processes for long periods as thermal throttling would likely result, the fan cooled MacBook Pro with M1-Pro, or M1-Max processors would be a better option for sustained intensive workloads.

I also compiled the Go version for both ARM64 and x86_64 (AMD64) architectures and ran the x86 version under the integrated Rosetta2 x86 emulator on the M1, and as can be seen in the 4th row below. The M1 can run x86 binaries under emulation faster than three of the system did natively, which is very impressive.

\*\* These are active HPC systems with other jobs running on them during this testing which likely impacted the results to a degree and introduced some variability.  

Apple just released new MacBook Air with an upgraded M2 processor that is reportedly 25% faster than the M1 system tested above, but with all new products, it's probably best to wait a few months for any potential problems are identified. If you plan on using an M1 system for CPU/data intensive workloads, you'd be better served by the 14" or 16" MacBook Pro with it's active cooling system and more CPU/GPU cores.
